
TODO LIST:

- Allow input from file

- It would be nice if random graphical games allowed players 
	to have varying numbers of actions

- Add more normal form games
	- Potential games
	- SAT games
	- Network games
	- others?

- Add framework for extensive form games plus some samples

- Can normalization be made more efficient?

- In some games have only implemented the one version of 
	getPayoff where a payoff for a single player is calculated.  
	Should go back and see if it would be more efficient in 
	some of these to calculate all payoffs at once.
